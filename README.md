# Belly Button Biodiversity

Background
In this assignment, I will built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. Yes, navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the dashboard you can sift through all the json data and view the demographic information, top 10 bacteria strains, and bacteria per sample.
